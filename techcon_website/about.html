                <p>History of Technology
                    T.P. Hughes, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001
                    
                    History of technology includes history of invention, development and innovation, as well as history of engineering and applied science. Historians of technology have varied backgrounds including engineering, economic history, labor history, history of science, sociology, and social history. Since World War II, the history of technology has taken on some of the attributes of a discipline through the establishment of graduate programs and a scholarly journal of international repute. Historians of technology have focused upon several themes including the relationship between science and technology, the nature of invention, development and innovation, the interaction of technology and environment, and gender studies. Histories of technology have usually taken the narrative form, but since the 1980s sociologists interested in the history of technology have introduced the social contructivist and the actor network approaches. These along with a systems approach are methodologies often used by historians and sociologists of technology.</p>
